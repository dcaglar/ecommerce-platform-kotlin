# üõí ecommerce-platform-kotlin

A **modular**, **event-driven**, and **resilient** eCommerce backend prototype built with **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot
**, demonstrating how to design a high-throughput system (like Amazon or bol.com) using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
and **Hexagonal Architecture**.

> üöß Currently focused on the `payment-service` module. Other modules (like order, wallet, and shipment) are planned for
> future development.

## üìå Overview

This project simulates a real-world multi-seller eCommerce platform where:

- A single order may contain products from multiple sellers.
- Each seller must be paid independently.
- Payment flow must handle failures, retries, and PSP timeouts robustly.
- All communication is decoupled using Kafka events.
- Observability and fault tolerance are built-in from day one.

---

## üîç Why This Project Exists

- Showcase scalable architecture choices in high-volume systems.
- Demonstrate mastery of **DDD**, **modularity**, **event choreography**, and **resilience patterns**.
- Enable others to contribute and learn by building well-structured components.

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular multi-module Maven layout designed for scalability and maintainability.

For detailed folder and package structure, see [docs/folder-structure.md](./docs/folder-structure.md).  
For architectural principles and deployment plans,  and detailed  diagrams see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

## ‚úÖ Current Focus: `payment-service`

Handles the full lifecycle of payment processing for multi-seller orders:

### üåê Responsibilities

- Generate and persist `Payment` and multiple `PaymentOrder`s (one per seller).
- Use Redis for ID generation (payment and paymentOrder).
- Create outbox events for Kafka: `payment_order_created`.
- Consume `payment_order_created` events and process via a mock PSP.
- Retry failed payments with backoff (via Redis).
- Schedule delayed status checks.
- Emit follow-up events like `payment_order_succeeded`, `retry_requested`, `status_check_scheduled`.
- Gracefully recover Redis ID state on startup.
- All domain changes live in the payment-service.

---

## üß± Architecture Principles

### ‚úÖ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Clear separation of `domain`, `application`, `adapter`, and `config` layers.
- Domain logic isolated and testable; all IO abstracted via ports.

### ‚úÖ Hexagonal Architecture

- Adapters implement ports and isolate external dependencies.
- Prevents domain leakage and encourages modular evolution.

### ‚úÖ Event-Driven Communication

- Kafka events drive all workflows.
- Events wrapped in custom `EventEnvelope` with traceability (`traceId`, `parentEventId`).

### ‚úÖ Observability

- Structured JSON logs with `logstash-logback-encoder`.
- MDC context propagation.
- Metrics planned with Prometheus/Micrometer.
- Full event traceability via logging and Elasticsearch.

### ‚úÖ Resilience Patterns

- Redis ZSet for short-term retry queue.
- PostgreSQL + scheduled jobs for long-term status checks.
- Retry, backoff, dead letter queues (DLQ) supported.
- Redis-backed ID generation with crash recovery.
- Mock PSP simulates network delays, failures, and pending states.
