/**
 * Represents a monetary amount using the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents, pence).
 *
 * Examples:
 * - $0.99 USD = Amount(quantity = 99, currency = Currency("USD"))
 * - $20.00 USD = Amount(quantity = 2000, currency = Currency("USD"))
 * - €15.50 EUR = Amount(quantity = 1550, currency = Currency("EUR"))
 *
 * This approach avoids floating-point precision issues and rounding errors.
 * 
 * Note: Amounts must be created using the factory method Amount.of() which enforces
 * that quantity > 0. This prevents zero or negative amounts from being created.
